# Neurology Board Questions Performance Analysis: GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4

This repository contains the code and metadata related to our project where we aimed to evaluate the performance of the latest large language models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, on Neurology board questions. 

## Overview

1. *Testing Language Models:* We test GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on sets of neurology board questions.
2. *Performance Assessment:* We assess the performance of these models based on question types and topics.
3. *Question-Answer Embeddings Analysis:* We further analyze the question and answer embeddings of the board questions.
